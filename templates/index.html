        <hr class="about-hr">
        <p class="about-p">Technology has become a facet that shapes every day of our lives. From our phones, laptops, cars (even air conditioning!), the products of scientific exploration is all around us. SparkCode is a coding camp founded by local high school students in Spokane, Washington, aimed at teaching elementary through middle school students practical and interesting coding. Typical camps last 3-4 days, around an hour after school. The camps are taught to be engaging, combining critical and creative thinking within the realms of science.</p>

        <p class="about-p"> 
            Past camps have been on the topics of Scratch, where students learned to program their own games. Students will spend the first days completing lessons taught by instructors before eventually completing a final project! The final project tends to be the studentâ€™s favorite aspect, as they also receive the opportunity to showcase their learning and what they created! For 2023 camps students will learn about creating their own website using HTML and CSS. Camps are taught beginner friendly, and zero coding experience is necessary.
        </p>

        <h1 class="index-head" id="exactlocation" >Initiative</h1>
        <hr class="about-hr">
        <p class="about-p">The initiative of SparkCode is to expose younger students to heart of science and the possibilities of code. Often, computer science classes are saved until High School, but with the work we have done, it is evident that younger students are perfectly capable of understanding practical computer science methodology. It never ceases to amaze us, the incredible amount of learning students accomplish in just 4 days. The ability to code and utilize technology is a valuable tool. Whether it be through activism, community efforts, global initiatives, code has the possibility to influence the world.</p>

        <p class="about-p"> By spreading of our love of science, we hope to inspire young students to utilize technology to aid their communities and learning. STEM is a growing field, and the values of science and code continue to shape our world.
